Description: An implementation of calculating the R-squared measure as a total mediation effect size measure and its confidence interval for moderate- or high-dimensional mediator models. It gives an option to filter out non-mediators using variable selection methods. The original R package is directly related to the paper Yang et al (2021) "Estimation of mediation effect for high-dimensional omics mediators with application to the Framingham Heart Study" <doi:10.1101/774877>. The new version contains a choice of using cross-fitting, which is computationally faster. The details of the cross-fitting method are available in the paper Xu et al (2023) "Speeding up interval estimation for R2-based mediation effect of high-dimensional mediators via cross-fitting" <doi:10.1101/2023.02.06.527391>.
