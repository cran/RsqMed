Description: An implementation of calculating the R-squared measure as a total mediation effect size measure and its confidence interval for moderate- or high-dimensional mediator model. It gives an option to filter out non-mediators using variable selection method. This R package is directly related to the paper "Estimation of mediation effect for high-dimensional omics mediators with application to the Framingham Heart Study" with <doi:10.1101/774877>.
